## About this project

To get this application of the ground I employed the use of OpenWeathers API in order to retrieve current weather conditions of the locations the users insert into the search bar. Using AJAX calls and the like I parsed the information into a current weather container and a 5 day future forecast set of cards for the user to gain information from.
